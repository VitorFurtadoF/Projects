# Competitive vs Planner outcome

## Description 

As an application to an undergraduate research assistant job, I have created a script that uses the scipy
library to determine how competitive and planner economies would respond to the following prompt: 

"
There are two identical locations that each produce in two industries. There are initially a unit
measure of firms in each location and each industry. Every firm produces a unique product, and has a
unique competitor that is located in the other location and produces a competing product. Competing
products are more highly substitutable with one another than they are with other products. Each
firm has its own fixed cost to move from their initial location to the other. Every frm uses only labor
to create its output.

Firms may benefit from moving between locations for two reasons. First, when an industry has
a larger number of firms in a location, all firms operating in that industry and located there have
lower marginal costs. Therefore, firms want to agglomerate in the same location as the other firms
in their industry. Second, when two firms producing competing products are in the same location,
they partially collude on prices. This increases their prices and profits.

We will compute the number of firms N that move from their initial location to their competing
firm's location. The \competitive outcome" is when firms move until the marginal firm is indifierent
between moving and not. The \planner's outcome" is when the utility of consumers, who receive
wages from working, receive profits from the firms, and buy output from firms, is maximized."
