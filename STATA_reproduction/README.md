# STATA Reproduction

## Description

During my Grad Econometrics class, it became very useful to have a function that regressed y on x in MATLAB and that reported a STATA like regression table.
I have included in this folder a .mat code that contains this function alongside a simple regression example using the file cps09mar.xlsx, which is available 
in Professor Hansen's website: https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/
