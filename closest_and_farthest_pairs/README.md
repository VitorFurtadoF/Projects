# Sample_Code

## Description

This is the solution to a Research Assistant position challenge at a top 5 Econ University. The challenge was to find the closest and farthest pair of points in a vector of n points. The points are uniform random samples of the unit square. 

The code find those pairs and plot the closest ones in blue and the farthest one in red. 

The conclusion is that the farthest pair of points accumulate themselves on the corners as n increases (as expected), while the closest pair of points are still randomly uniformily distributed across the unit square.
