# Efficient Market Hypothesis and Robert Shiller's 

## Description 

I have collaborated with Ms. Gruler, Mr. Heatherman, Mr. Goff, and Mr. Silva Simoes on a Final Project for the class Mathematical Methods in Financial Economics class. This projects examined the theoretical background behind stock pricing and the effects of volatility and reproduced Robert Shillerâ€™s statistical analysis of the Efficient Market Hypothesis using Python. 

For the latter, we created a python script that analyzed the volatility of the stock market and compared it to what would be expected from the theory of rational expectation.
